# odin-recipes

My first Odin project!

I have created a very simple recipe website using HTML. This project demonstrates my ability to create and reference different HTML docs. It also highlights my ability to use elements to add content to a webpage. Additionally, this projects shows how I update information when commiting.

3/27: Project now displays my knowledge of CSS including the usage of Flex to arrange items on a webpage
